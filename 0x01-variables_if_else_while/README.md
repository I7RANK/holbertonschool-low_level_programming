## 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

**0-positive_or_negative.c:** Each time the program is run the variable `n` saves a random number and the program will print the number followed by:
- if the number is greater than 0: it is positive.
- if the number is 0: it is zero.
- if the number is less than 0: it is negative.

**1-last_digit.c:** Also has a random `n` variable
The output of the program is:
- The string `Last digit of`, followed by
- `n`, followed by
  - The string `is`, followed by
  - if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5: the string `and is greater than 5`
  - if the last digit of `n` is 0: the string `and is 0`
  - if the last digit of `n` is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6 and not 0`
